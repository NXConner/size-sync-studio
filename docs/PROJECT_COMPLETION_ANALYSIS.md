## 🚀 OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. **Performance Optimizations**
```typescript
// Implement lazy loading for heavy OpenCV.js
const LazyMeasurePage = lazy(() => 
  import('./pages/Measure').then(module => ({
    default: module.default
  }))
);

// Add service worker for offline capabilities
// Add image compression before storage
// Implement virtual scrolling for large galleries
```

### 2. **Code Architecture Improvements**
```typescript
// Create centralized store management
// Implement proper error boundaries
// Add comprehensive TypeScript strict mode compliance
// Refactor large components into smaller, focused units
```

### 3. **Security Enhancements**
```typescript
// Implement Content Security Policy
// Add input validation schemas
// Enhance crypto implementation with proper key derivation
// Add secure session management
```

### 4. **User Experience Improvements**
```typescript
// Add progressive loading states
// Implement offline mode indicators  
// Add keyboard shortcuts throughout app
// Enhance voice guidance with more contextual feedback
```

### 5. **Mobile App Completion**
```kotlin
// Complete Android ML integration
// Add native performance optimizations
// Implement background processing for analysis
// Add native sharing capabilities
```
